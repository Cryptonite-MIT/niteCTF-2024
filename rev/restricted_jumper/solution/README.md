## Restricted Jumper Solution

**Description**: Unity rev

**Task 1:** fix the camera to move WITH the player. not only to prevent respawning but also to see where you're going.
You cannot go anywhere apart from right due to boundary restrictions. So you keep jumping to the right which is a VERY LONG PATH.

**Task 2:** speed your character up else it'll take too long :/
You reach the end of the path only to find a sad face telling you to go back and jump left from the beginning.

**Task 3:** Lift boundary restrictions so that you can go out of bounds to the bottom left
You reach the hidden area with the gold portal that can take you to 101 scenes. 96 scenes are dummy :( and 5 scenes have the flag.

**Task 4:** 5/101 chance to get flag ( i think i want to increase it to 1000 scenes)
In the portal code, you can only go to 100 scenes, i.e. the last part of the flag is in a scene where you can't go due to it being absent from portal code

**Task 5:** Figure that out and get to the last scene to complete the flag.
