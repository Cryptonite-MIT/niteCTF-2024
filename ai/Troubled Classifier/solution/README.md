# Solution
1. Users need to test the model on the given dataset. 
2. It will be seen that the model shows drastic drop in accuracy for a few classes (classes 2,7,9)
3. Upon investigating the images of these classes, it will be seen that the images have been manipulated.This manipulation is the reason the model was not performing as expected.
4. Upon decoding these bit manipulations, the participant will find the flag.
